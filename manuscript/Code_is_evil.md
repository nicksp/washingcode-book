# Code is evil

The goal of programmer’s work isn’t writing code but solving your client’s problems, whether it’s your employer or yourself. Code is by-product, a necessary evil.

The less code we write, the better. Less code means easier testing, easier maintenance, faster app, less bytes to download… A perfect solution doesn’t include any new code or even removes some existing code. Perfect is the enemy of good and we’ll have to write some code — they wouldn’t have called us programmers otherwise — but we should try to write as little code as possible, and don’t consider writing code as a goal in itself.
