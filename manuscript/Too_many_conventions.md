# Too many conventions

Conventions are great, because they make code more consistent and reduce cognitive load when you read code. But the more conventions you have, the harder it is to maintain them.

Ask yourself, where a particular convention really make code more readable or reduce number of bugs. If yes, automate it. If you canâ€™t automate, ask yourself again: will cost of maintaining a convention lower than benefits of having it.

Code reviewers will have to remember all the conventions, and make sure developers follow them in their code. This will distract them from finding actually important issues in the code.
