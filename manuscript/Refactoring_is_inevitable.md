# Refactoring is inevitable

TODO: Don’t be attached to your code

TODO: Don’t rewrite everything (unless you have good tests)

TODO: Second system syndrome (?)

TODO: Write code that is easy to delete

TODO: Disposable software

TODO: Required refactoring before doing a task and general refactoring unrelated to any particular task

Bigger refactoring projects may be hard to sell to your boss. Look for signs: too many bugs in some part of code, growing code spagettiness because of many changes in the same place. These are the places worth improving.

Try to avoid rewriting everything at once.
