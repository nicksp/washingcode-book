# Preface

The title of this book should be “What 23 years of programming have taught me about writing good code” or “What I tell folks during code reviews while trying to decipher their code,” but both are too long, so “Write once, read seven times” it is. We can even shorten it to WORST because everyone loves nonsensical acronyms.

“Write once, read seven times” is a variation of a famous Russian proverb “Measure seven times, cut once.” The idea is that we read code more often than we write it, so it makes more sense to optimize for the ease of reading than the ease of writing.

This book is going to be opinionated, but you don’t have to agree with everything I’m saying. That’s not the goal of the book. The goal is to show you one of the possible paths, mine, and inspire you to find your own. These techniques help me to write and review code every day, and I’ll be happy if you find some of them useful. Let me know how it goes.

The book is probably most useful for intermediate developers. If you’re a beginner, you’ll likely have plenty of other things to think about. If you have decades of experience, you can probably write a similar book yourself. Either way, I’d be happy to hear your feedback.

Most of the examples in this book are in JavaScript because that’s my primary language, but you can apply the ideas to any language. Sometimes you’ll see CSS and HTML because similar ideas can be applied there too.

I’ve taken most of the examples from real code, with only minor adaptation, mostly different names. I spend several hours every week reviewing other developers’ code, and that gives me enough experience to tell which patterns make the code more readable and which don’t.

And remember, there are no strict rules in programming, except that you should always use three-space indentation in your code.
