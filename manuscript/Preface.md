# Preface

This book is about what I’ve learned about writing code since I retyped my first BASIC program from a book into a Soviet clone of ZX Spectrum in 1997. I’ve learned many other things of course, but this book focuses on the craft of programming — writing clean code.

Everything I’ve learned while working as a frontend engineer for almost 20 years. Everything I’ve learned on my personal projects. Everything I’ve learned by developing and maintaining my open source projects. Everything I’ve learned reviewing hundreds of pull requests…

We, programmers, read code more often than we write it, so it makes more sense to optimize for the ease of reading instead of the ease of writing. The practice of writing code that is easy to read is known as _clean code_.

This book is going to be opinionated, but you don’t have to agree with everything I’m saying. That’s not the goal of the book. The goal is to show you one of the possible paths, and inspire you to find your own. These techniques help me to write and review code every day, and I’ll be happy if you find some of them useful.

The book is probably most useful for intermediate developers. If you’re a beginner, you’ll likely have plenty of other things to think about. If you have decades of experience, you can probably write a similar book yourself. Either way, I’d be happy to hear your feedback.

Most of the examples in this book are in JavaScript because that’s my main language, but you can apply many ideas to other languages too. Sometimes you’ll see CSS and HTML because similar ideas can be applied there too.

I’ve taken most of the examples from real code, with only minor adaptations — mostly different names. I spend several hours every week reviewing other developers’ code, and that gives me enough experience to tell which patterns make the code more readable and which don’t.

I’ll try to keep this book up-to-date, as some kind of a living document for myself and my poor memory.

And remember the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” for programmers is “it depends” — there are no strict rules in programming.
