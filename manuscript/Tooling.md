### Tooling

Most of this book is about **conventions**. For example, don’t mutate your code, and the next programmer will have less troubles understanding it, and you’ll avoid some nasty bugs. This is a convention, meaning we’re agreeing to do something but there’s no way to enforce it. Developers are still free to mutate any value accidentally or due to evil intent.

TODO: Not sure it’s actually a convention, it’s more of a flag to stop and think

Conventions are good because they are easy to implement: document your decision and make the team aware of it. Conventions are not good because they are just words, and there’s nothing to enforce the convention, except more work, like code review comments.

The are tools to enforce some of the conventions and help up keep the codebase healthy.
